Frontend (React + Vite)
-----------------------

This repository now contains a minimal React frontend located in `frontend/`.

Quick start (frontend):

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The frontend talks to the backend at `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can override with `VITE_API_URL`.
