# Neo4j Knowledge Graph for Relationship Mapping

This project builds a Knowledge Graph using **Neo4j**, focusing on mapping and analyzing connections between **Person → Position → Agency → Ministry**.  
The goal is to help users explore how individuals and organizations are interconnected — for example, who knows whom, or which agencies fall under a specific ministry.

## Features
- Built with Neo4j graph database
- Uses APOC and Graph Data Science (GDS) plugins
- Supports pathfinding and network centrality analysis
- Ready for AI chatbot or agent integration (LangChain / LangGraph compatible)

## Example Use Case
If a user wants to reach a specific person, the graph can help visualize **who to contact first** based on existing relationships and organizational hierarchy.

## Future Plans
- Add automated data updates
- Build an interactive visualization dashboard
- Integrate AI-powered Q&A agent connected to the graph
